As an algorithm problem coach your task is to review the current attempt of a user to solve a algorithmic coding problem and provide guide to the user based on the specified level of help between 1, 2, and 3. Level 1 of help is the least amount of help with only small hints, level 3 is the most level of help with you basically providing the algorithm and steps on how to implement the algorithm, and code. Level 2 is in between with you providing algorithm steps, but not actually providing the code to implement the algorithms. Again Make sure you do not provide any code for level 1 and 2. Your guide should solely focus on the correctness of the solution based on the problem descriptions and the problem constraints. Your response needs to be entirely returned in markdown format so it can be processed by the application. 

Below you can find how to interpret a user submission. 

The problem description, constraints, and example(s) will be delimited within "Problem Description Start" and "Problem Description End" 

The user code will be delimited within "User Code Start" and "User Code End"

The level of help will be a number between 1 to 3 followed by the word "help level" and colons.

Consider the user submission below and the expected output by you:

Problem Description Start

Can you solve this real interview question? Regular Expression Matching - Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
 * '.' Matches any single character.

 * '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.


The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"

Output: false

Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"

Output: true

Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".


Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"

Output: true

Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".


Constraints:
 * 1 <= s.length <= 20

 * 1 <= p.length <= 20

 * s contains only lowercase English letters.

 * p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.

 * It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

**Detailed Explanation and Correct Solution**

Your approach to use recursion with memoization is a good start. However, the `dfs` function is incomplete and does not handle the `*` character and the matching logic fully. Here is a detailed solution:

1. **Define the Base Cases:**
   - If both `s` and `p` are fully matched, return `true`.
   - If `p` is exhausted but `s` is not, return `false`.

2. **Matching Logic:**
   - If the current characters of `s` and `p` match, or `p[j]` is `.`:
     - Move to the next character in both `s` and `p`.

3. **Handling `*`:**
   - If `p[j+1]` is `*`, we have two choices:
     - Ignore the `*` and move to the next character in `p` (`dfs(i, j+2)`).
     - Use the `*` and match the current character in `s` (`dfs(i+1, j)`), provided the current characters of `s` and `p` match.


Here is the corrected code:

```cpp

class Solution {
public:

    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, bool>> memo; 
        return dfs(0, 0, s, p, memo);
    }
    bool dfs(int i, int j, const string& s, const string& p, unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, bool>> &memo) {
        if(memo.find(i) != memo.end() && memo[i].find(j) != memo[i].end())
            return memo[i][j];
        if (j >= p.length()){
            return i >= s.length(); 
        }
        bool match = (i < s.length() && (s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '.'));
        if (j + 1 < p.length() && p[j + 1] == '*') {
            memo[i][j] = (dfs(i, j + 2, s, p, memo) || (match && dfs(i + 1, j, s, p, memo)));
        } else {
            memo[i][j] = match && dfs(i + 1, j + 1, s, p, memo);
        }
        return memo[i][j];
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **Base Case Handling:** If both `i` and `j` reach the end of `s` and `p`, return `true`. If only `j` reaches the end, return `false`.

2. **Matching Logic:** Check if the current characters of `s` and `p` match or if `p[j]` is `.`.

3. **Handling `*`:** If the next character in `p` is `*`, we consider both the possibilities - ignoring the `*` or using the `*`.

4. **Memoization:** Store and reuse the results of previously computed states to avoid redundant computations.


This solution ensures that all the cases are handled correctly and efficiently within the given constraints.
