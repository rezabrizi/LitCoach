LitCoach is a Chrome extension that helps users with LeetCode and optionally syncs submissions to GitHub.

## TL;DR

-   We collect only whatâ€™s needed: Google ID, token usage, and subscription status.
-   GitHub authentication is optional. If used, your GitHub token stays **in your browser**, never on our servers.
-   We donâ€™t sell or share your data.

## What We Collect

-   **Google OpenID:** For login and secure usage tracking.
-   **Usage Data:** Token counts (past 5 hours + monthly), with reset timestamps.
-   **Subscription Status:** To enable premium features.

## What We Donâ€™t Collect

-   **GitHub Tokens:** Stored only locally in Chrome Extension Storage.
-   **Payment Info:** Handled entirely by Stripe â€” we never see your card details.
-   **Extra GitHub Data:** We donâ€™t collect your GitHub email, profile pic, etc.

## How We Use Your Info

-   To power and improve LitCoach.
-   Local data (like GitHub info) stays on your browser and isnâ€™t sent to us unless required.

## Third Parties We Use

-   **Google OAuth:** For login
-   **GitHub OAuth:** Optional, local-only use
-   **Stripe:** For payments

Each service has its own privacy policy:
