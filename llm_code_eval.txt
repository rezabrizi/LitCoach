Task: Given a problem, current user code, and a help level provide assistance to the user
to solve the problem. 

Problems:
1- Absolute evaluation of the correctness of code (deterministic)
2- The task is the exact same everytime, is there a way to only say it once, instead of
saying that with every prompt? 
3- More concise response


Turn the problem into a state machine by having subtasks of a complex task

1- Is the problem correct or not? 
2a- if the problem is correct: Help level is not necessary and only suggestions can be given 


Give the model time to think by having various prompts and using inner monologue 




Analysis: 
How does a LLM know that code to an algorithmic problem is correct? By comparing the question
and answer to correct answers that it knows.
